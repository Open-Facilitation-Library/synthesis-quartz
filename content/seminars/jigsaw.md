## Overview

The Jigsaw team presented findings from their facilitation research, revealing a typology of structured conversations and insights from interviews with 22 expert facilitators globally.

## Typology of Structured Conversations

Three distinct types identified:

### 1. Transformative Conversations
- Focus on relationship repair
- Emotional processing central
- Requires deep trust and safety

### 2. Generative Conversations
- Ideation and creativity
- Divergent thinking encouraged
- Building new possibilities

### 3. Deliberative Conversations
- Decision-focused
- Weighing options and trade-offs
- Working toward actionable outcomes

Each type requires distinct facilitation approaches.

## Key Research Findings

### Pre-Conversation Work is Critical
- Most important facilitation happens *before* the conversation
- Aligning processes with clear objectives
- Preparing materials and participants

### Facilitator Tools
Current tools used by facilitators include:
- Google Docs for collaborative work
- AI applications like ChatGPT for preparation
- Various digital platforms for engagement

### AI's Role
AI enhances workflows without replacing core human tasks:
- Preparation and synthesis
- Pattern recognition
- Documentation

## Strategic Facilitator Capabilities

Facilitators need to:
- **Maintain decision openness** - Keep options alive until appropriate
- **Foster group cohesion** - Build connections across differences
- **Emphasize the bigger picture** - Connect discussions to larger purpose

## Jigsaw's Role

Described as a "nimble incubator" focusing on:
- Research partnerships
- Supporting civic discourse
- Developing tools for deliberation

## Open Facilitation Library

Discussion of developing a library to:
- Codify facilitation techniques
- Make patterns machine-readable
- Ensure alignment with core facilitation values

## Collaboration Opportunities

- Digital Commons Portland gathering
- Metagov civic tech community
- Continued research partnerships

## Key Insight

> "Facilitation is not just about what happens in the room—it's about everything that makes the conversation possible."
