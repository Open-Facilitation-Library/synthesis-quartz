## Overview

Cecile Green presented the Commoning Standard, a theoretical framework rooted in 20 years of research on systemic crises caused by power misuse.

## The Commoning Standard

### Foundation
A comprehensive approach to:

### Research Basis
Built on understanding systemic crises resulting from:
- Power concentration
- Governance failures
- Communication breakdowns

## Organizational Power Matrix

A tool for analyzing collaborative power dynamics:
- Maps power relationships within organizations
- Identifies healthy vs. unhealthy power patterns
- Guides interventions for better governance

- Ensuring equitable participation
- Making transparent decisions

## Living Spreadsheet Architecture

A methodology for:
- Integrating diverse contributions into governance
- Maintaining dynamic, evolving documentation
- Supporting collective decision-making

## Integrative Consent

Decision-making process that:
- Seeks workable solutions rather than unanimous agreement
- Addresses objections constructively
- Enables forward progress while respecting concerns

## AI & Evaluation

Discussion of:
- AI's role in evaluating facilitation quality
- Need for granular criteria for AI assessments
- Using AI prompts to process transcripts through commoning framework

## Strategic Alignment

Focus areas for future work:
- Technical implementations
- Contributor integration
- Developer requirements for AI evaluation tools

## Action Items

- Follow up with Liz on governance loop integration
- Determine granularity needs for AI evaluations
- Explore AI prompts for transcript processing experiments

## Resources

- Commoning Standard documentation
- Round Sky Solutions governance frameworks
