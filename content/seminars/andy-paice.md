**Date**: September 2, 2025
**Speaker**: Andy Paice (7+ years in deliberative democracy)
**Duration**: ~70 minutes

---

## Overview

Andy Paice shared insights from designing and facilitating citizen assemblies, covering the full process from sortition to recommendations.

## Citizen Assembly Structure

### Scale & Duration
- Typically 50-100 randomly selected participants
- 30-40 hours of engagement
- Structured across multiple sessions

### Three Stages

1. **Learning** - Participants receive balanced information
2. **Deliberation** - Small group discussions with trained facilitators
3. **Recommendation** - Developing and voting on proposals

## Inclusive Facilitation Principles

Key elements for inclusive facilitation:
- **Psychological safety** - Creating space where all feel comfortable contributing
- **Plain language** - Avoiding jargon and technical terms
- **Tools for confusion** - Giving participants ways to express when they don't understand
- **Fostering empathy** - Building connections across different perspectives

## Core Facilitation Skills

Essential competencies highlighted:
- **Active listening** - Full attention and genuine curiosity
- **Effective questioning** - Open questions that deepen thinking
- **Adapting to group dynamics** - Reading the room and adjusting

## Dynamic Facilitation

Paice discussed Dynamic Facilitation techniques using four charts:

| Chart | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Data** | Facts and information shared |
| **Problems** | Issues and concerns raised |
| **Solutions** | Ideas and proposals offered |
| **Action Steps** | Concrete next moves |

This approach promotes collective solutions by capturing all contributions visually.

## AI Applications Discussed

Potential AI roles explored:
- Addressing facilitator bias
- Enhancing participant reflection
- The concept of an "AI facilitator for each participant"
- Supporting synthesis across small groups

## Collaboration Opportunities

Discussed during the session:
- Partnership on the Commoning Standard project
- Formation of Open Facilitation Library cooperative
- Connecting with Rosa Zubizarreta on dynamic facilitation

## Resources

- Group Works card deck for facilitation building blocks
- Rosa Zubizarreta's dynamic facilitation resources
- Open Facilitation Library cooperative membership

## Key Takeaway

> "The most important facilitation happens before and between the sessions, not just during them."
