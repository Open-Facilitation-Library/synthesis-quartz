# Martin Carcasson: Deliberative Facilitation & Wicked Problems

**Date**: August 5, 2025
**Speaker**: Martin Carcasson, Colorado State University
**Duration**: ~70 minutes

---

## Overview

Martin Carcasson presented on deliberative facilitation through the lens of wicked problems, emphasizing how facilitators should focus on values and tensions rather than individual blame.

## Key Concepts

### The Wicked Problems Lens

Wicked problems are complex challenges that resist simple solutions. Carcasson urged facilitators to:
- Focus on underlying values and tensions
- Avoid assigning individual blame
- Recognize that "solutions" often create new problems

### Three Types of Conversations

A framework for fostering innovative solutions:

1. **Balancing** - Working within existing trade-offs
2. **Recalibrating** - Adjusting the balance points
3. **Transcending** - Finding creative solutions that move beyond the original framing

### Argument Mapping

Carcasson advocated for comprehensive argument mapping *before* facilitated events to:
- Ensure solid foundations for dialogue
- Surface the full landscape of perspectives
- Prepare facilitators for likely tensions

### Deliberation vs. Debate vs. Dialogue

| Mode | Characteristics |
|------|-----------------|
| **Debate** | Win/lose, adversarial, quick |
| **Dialogue** | Understanding, exploratory, open |
| **Deliberation** | Decision-focused, weighing trade-offs, requires more resources |

Deliberation needs more resources than debate or dialogue but produces superior outcomes for complex decisions.

## Principled Impartiality

Facilitators should practice "principled impartiality":
- Balance commitment to democratic values
- Build and maintain trust with all parties
- Avoid taking sides while still upholding process integrity

## Key Facilitator Moves

Practical techniques shared:
- **Managing speaking order** - Ensuring equitable participation
- **Paraphrasing** - Reflecting back to ensure understanding
- **Perspective-taking prompts** - Encouraging participants to consider other viewpoints

## Small Group Facilitation

Carcasson highlighted:
- The necessity of small group work for genuine deliberation
- Need for adaptable templates in citizen assemblies
- Importance of trained facilitators at each table

## AI & Facilitation

Discussion of how AI tools can:
- Enhance (not replace) human facilitation skills
- Support democratic capacity building
- Help with argument mapping and synthesis
