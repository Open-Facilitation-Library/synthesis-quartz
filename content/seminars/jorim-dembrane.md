# Jorim (Dembrane): Echo Tool & Real-time Summarization

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Speaker**: Jorim, Dembrane
**Duration**: ~53 minutes

---

## Overview

Jorim introduced Echo, a tool combining Mentimeter-style input collection with ChatGPT for real-time summarization and brainstorming in live events.

## Echo Tool

### What It Does
- Combines input collection (like Mentimeter) with AI summarization
- Enables real-time participant engagement via QR codes
- Supports live transcription with minimal delay

### How It Works
1. Participants scan QR code to join
2. Submit responses to prompts
3. AI processes and synthesizes in real-time
4. Host can interact with and display results

## Key Design Principles

### Participant-Driven Summaries
- Prioritize participant feedback over complex AI methods
- Early compression attempts were deemed ineffective
- Human correction and audit preferred over AI-only summarization

### Flexible Prompt Styles
- Crafted collaboratively with hosts
- Cater to diverse preferences
- Iterative refinement during sessions

## Technical Infrastructure

Building robust systems for:
- Large-scale simultaneous live audio streams
- Real-time transcription
- High-volume event support

## Ethical Considerations

Important discussions on:
- Participant consent for data use
- Privacy in transcript sharing
- Transparent AI processing

## Cross-Pollination Potential

Explored AI's potential for:
- Idea cross-pollination in large groups
- Connecting themes across breakout sessions
- Identifying patterns in participant responses

## Minimum Viable Ontology

Concept discussed:
- Iterative human-in-the-loop validation
- Mind map creation with participant feedback
- Democratic assembly context constraints

## Focus on Simplicity

> Simple, participant-centered processes lead to better adoption and outcomes.

Key emphasis on:
- Avoiding over-engineering
- Prioritizing user experience
- Making tools accessible to non-technical facilitators

## Collaboration Opportunities

- Standards development for AI cross-pollination
- Metrics and ethical considerations
- Integration with OFL pattern library
