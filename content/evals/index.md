# Evaluation Frameworks

Tools and schemas for assessing facilitation quality.

## Why-How-Who Framework

Based on Joseph Low's research at Cooperative AI, this framework provides:
- **Why**: Purpose and intended outcomes of facilitation
- **How**: Process characteristics and intervention styles
- **Who**: Participant dynamics and roles

See: [[evals/why-how-who-framework|Why-How-Who Framework]]

## Evaluation Approaches

- **Process-based**: Measuring facilitation technique adherence
- **Outcome-based**: Measuring discussion quality and results
- **Conversation signatures**: Comparing discussions to known facilitation styles
