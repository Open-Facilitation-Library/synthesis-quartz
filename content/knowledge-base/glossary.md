# OFL Glossary

Core terms and definitions used across the Open Facilitation Library.

---

## A

### Adversarial Cross-Pollination
A variant of cross-pollination that deliberately exposes participants to maximally opposing viewpoints, measured by embedding distance.

### Artifact
Any output produced during a facilitation process that can be passed to subsequent phases or sessions. Examples: summaries, vote tallies, clustered opinions.

### Asynchronous Facilitation
Facilitation conducted over time without requiring simultaneous presence of all participants. Enables scale and thoughtful responses.

---

## C

### Conversation Signature
A vector representation of a conversation's characteristics based on dialogue act tagging. Used to compare conversations to known facilitation styles.

### Cross-Pollination
A deliberation technique where participants are exposed to opinions different from their own to broaden understanding and foster perspective-taking.

### Clustering
The process of grouping similar opinions or responses together to identify distinct viewpoints within a larger group.

---

## D

### Daisy-Chaining
Running multiple facilitation sessions in sequence, where outputs from one session become inputs to the next. Enables complex methodologies through simpler building blocks.

### Deliberative
A category of facilitation focused on collective decision-making, weighing options, and building consensus.

### Dialogue Act
A unit of conversational action (question, statement, clarification, etc.) that can be tagged for analysis.

---

## E

### Evaluation (Process-based)
Assessing facilitation quality by measuring characteristics of the process itself (intervention timing, question types, participation balance).

### Evaluation (Outcome-based)
Assessing facilitation quality by measuring results (agreement reached, participant satisfaction, action completion).

---

## F

### Facilitation Primitive
A basic building block of facilitation that can be composed into larger methodologies. Examples: probing question, summarization, reflection prompt.

### Fine-tuning
Training a language model on specific data to improve performance on particular tasks. Contrasts with prompt/skill-based approaches at inference time.

---

## G

### Generative
A category of facilitation focused on ideation, creativity, and producing new ideas or possibilities.

---

## H

### How (in Why-How-Who)
The process dimension of facilitation: what techniques are used, how the facilitator intervenes, and the structure of the interaction.

---

## I

### Inference-time Skills
Enhancing AI capabilities through prompts, tools, and context rather than model fine-tuning. The approach used by Harmonica.

### Intervention Style
How a facilitator engages with participants: non-directive (minimal guidance), semi-directive (questions and summaries), or directive (active guidance).

---

## O

### One-to-One
Facilitation mode where the facilitator (human or AI) interacts with one participant at a time. Enables depth but requires synthesis across participants.

### Opinion Clustering
See Clustering.

---

## P

### Pattern
A documented facilitation methodology in machine-readable format, including purpose, process, and participant information.

### Perspective-Taking
An outcome goal of facilitation where participants gain understanding of viewpoints different from their own.

### Plenary
A facilitation mode involving the entire group simultaneously, typically for information sharing or final decisions.

### Preference Elicitation
An outcome goal of facilitation where individual preferences are surfaced and captured.

---

## R

### Reinforcement Learning (for Facilitation)
Training AI facilitators using feedback signals derived from conversation quality metrics and Why-How-Who evaluation.

---

## S

### Synchronous Facilitation
Facilitation conducted in real-time with all participants present simultaneously.

### Synthesis
An outcome goal of facilitation where diverse inputs are aggregated into coherent, actionable outputs.

---

## T

### Transformative
A category of facilitation focused on conflict resolution, perspective shifts, and relationship repair.

---

## W

### Why (in Why-How-Who)
The purpose dimension of facilitation: what outcomes the method aims to achieve (agreement, ideation, perspective-taking, etc.).

### Who (in Why-How-Who)
The participant dimension of facilitation: group size, roles, power dynamics, and interaction modes.

### Why-How-Who Framework
An evaluation framework for encoding and comparing facilitation methodologies across three dimensions: purpose, process, and participants.
