# Conversation Types in Facilitation

Understanding the different types of structured conversations helps select appropriate facilitation methods.

## Three Primary Types

Based on research from Google Jigsaw and the AI Facilitation seminar series, structured conversations can be categorized into three primary types:

### 1. Deliberative Conversations

**Purpose**: Collective decision-making, weighing options, building consensus

**Characteristics**:
- Focused on a specific decision or question
- Participants represent different viewpoints
- Goal is agreement or informed decision
- Often involves voting or preference aggregation

**Example Methods**:
- Delphi Method
- Cross-Pollination
- Consensus Workshop
- Citizens' Assembly

**AI Suitability**: High for information gathering and synthesis; human oversight needed for final decisions

### 2. Generative Conversations

**Purpose**: Ideation, creativity, producing new possibilities

**Characteristics**:
- Open-ended exploration
- Divergent thinking encouraged
- Quantity valued over immediate quality
- Building on others' ideas

**Example Methods**:
- Six Thinking Hats
- Brainstorming
- Design Thinking workshops
- Retrospectives

**AI Suitability**: Medium; AI can prompt and organize but human creativity remains central

### 3. Transformative Conversations

**Purpose**: Conflict resolution, perspective shifts, relationship repair

**Characteristics**:
- Emotional processing involved
- Identity and values at stake
- Deep listening required
- Focus on understanding over agreement

**Example Methods**:
- Nonviolent Communication (NVC)
- Restorative Justice circles
- Mediation
- Dynamic Facilitation

**AI Suitability**: Low; human empathy and presence crucial

## Implications for AI Facilitation

### What AI Does Well
- Structured information gathering
- Synthesis and summarization
- Pattern recognition across many inputs
- Consistent application of methodology
- Scaling to large groups asynchronously

### What Requires Human Facilitation
- Reading emotional undercurrents
- Navigating power dynamics in real-time
- Building trust and psychological safety
- Handling unexpected conflicts
- Making judgment calls on process

### Hybrid Approaches

The most promising applications combine AI and human facilitation:

1. **AI for scale**: Gather inputs from many participants via one-to-one AI conversations
2. **Human for depth**: Facilitate key moments requiring judgment and empathy
3. **AI for synthesis**: Aggregate and present findings
4. **Human for decisions**: Guide final decision-making

## Choosing the Right Type

| Situation | Recommended Type |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Need to make a group decision | Deliberative |
| Need new ideas or solutions | Generative |
| Conflict or damaged relationships | Transformative |
| Complex problem with multiple aspects | Combination |
