# Bringing Everyone to the Table

An experimental study comparing LLM facilitation to human facilitation and no facilitation in group decision-making tasks.

*Source: Experimental Study (2025)*

---

## Overview

This study experimentally compares different facilitation conditions (None, Message-only, Human, LLM) in group decision-making tasks. Participants worked in groups to select a host city for an international sporting event, with each participant holding unique information.

## Experimental Design

### Task
Groups evaluated three fictional cities (Eldoron, Myloria, Cragnio) as potential hosts for an international sporting event. Each participant held different facts about the cities.

### Conditions

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **None** | No facilitation |
| **Message** | Static facilitation message only |
| **Human** | Human facilitator |
| **LLM** | Large Language Model facilitator |

## Key Findings

### Information Sharing

LLM facilitation significantly increased information sharing compared to all other conditions:

| Comparison | Δ (difference) | t-statistic | p-value |
|------------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| LLM vs None | +2.9 | t(138) = 3.58 | p < 0.001 |
| LLM vs Message | +1.58 | t(139) = 2.1 | p = 0.02 |
| LLM vs Human | +2.47 | t(138) = 3.37 | p < 0.001 |

### Subjective Evaluations

Participants rated their experience on 5-point scales:

**Group Dynamics (A-D):**
- Ability to influence group decision
- Ability to contribute to discussion
- Productivity of discussion
- Structured information collection

**Facilitator Effectiveness (E-H):**
- Encouraged information sharing
- Was not distracting
- Helped summarize information
- Kept group focused on task

### Preference Asymmetry

An interesting asymmetry emerged in future facilitation preferences:
- Participants initially with **LLM facilitation** were open to both LLM and human facilitation in the future
- Participants initially with **human facilitation** were notably less inclined to consider future LLM facilitation

## Implications

### For LLM Facilitation Design
- LLMs can effectively increase information coverage in groups
- Structured facilitation prompts improve group outcomes
- User acceptance may depend on initial exposure

### For Human-AI Collaboration
- LLM facilitation complements rather than replaces human facilitation
- Different facilitation types suit different contexts
- Hybrid approaches may be optimal

## Relevance to OFL

### Pattern Development
- Provides experimental evidence for LLM facilitation effectiveness
- Quantifies information sharing improvements
- Identifies user preference patterns

### Evaluation Framework
- Offers validated subjective evaluation questions
- Demonstrates experimental methodology for facilitation comparison
- Provides baseline metrics for facilitation quality
