# Deliberative Mini-Publics Research

Research on small-scale deliberative forums and the role of facilitation in democratic processes.

---

## Overview

Deliberative mini-publics are small groups of randomly selected citizens who deliberate on policy issues. Key research explores how facilitation affects deliberation quality and outcomes.

## Key Research

### Landwehr (2014) - Impartial Intermediaries

**"Facilitating deliberation: The role of impartial intermediaries in deliberative mini-publics"**

Core findings:
- Facilitators serve as **impartial intermediaries** between citizens and institutions
- Neutrality is essential but challenging to maintain
- Facilitation quality directly impacts deliberation outcomes

| Facilitator Role | Function |
|-----------------|----------|
| Process guide | Manage discussion flow |
| Neutrality keeper | Avoid bias toward outcomes |
| Participation balancer | Ensure all voices heard |
| Information provider | Offer relevant context |

### Spada & Vreeland (2013) - Moderator Effects

**"Who moderates the moderators? The effect of non-neutral moderators in deliberative decision making"**

Key question: What happens when moderators aren't neutral?

Findings:
- Non-neutral moderation affects outcomes
- Participant awareness of bias varies
- Accountability mechanisms needed

### Gerber et al. (2018) - EuroPolis

**"Deliberative Abilities and Influence in a Transnational Deliberative Poll"**

Study of deliberative poll across European countries:
- Examined participant influence patterns
- Measured deliberative skill development
- Analyzed cross-cultural facilitation challenges

### Fishkin (1997) - Deliberative Polling

Foundational work on structured citizen deliberation:
- Random sampling for representativeness
- Balanced briefing materials
- Trained facilitators for small groups
- Pre/post opinion measurement

## Facilitation in Mini-Publics

### Core Challenges

1. **Maintaining neutrality** while guiding discussion
2. **Balancing participation** across different personality types
3. **Handling power dynamics** and status differences
4. **Managing time** while allowing deep exploration
5. **Bridging expertise gaps** between citizens and experts

### Best Practices

| Practice | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Trained facilitators | Consistency and quality |
| Clear ground rules | Psychological safety |
| Structured phases | Ensure coverage |
| Anonymous input options | Reduce hierarchy effects |
| Regular check-ins | Maintain inclusion |

## AI Facilitation Potential

### Opportunities

- **Scale**: AI can facilitate many small groups simultaneously
- **Consistency**: Same facilitation approach across groups
- **Neutrality**: Potentially less susceptible to certain biases
- **Documentation**: Automatic recording and synthesis

### Risks

- Loss of human connection and empathy
- Technical barriers to participation
- Opacity in facilitation decisions
- Potential for manipulation at scale

| Fora Corpus | US community facilitated dialogues |
| America in One Room | US deliberative poll |

## Key Concepts

### Deliberative Quality Indicators

From mini-publics research:
- **Justification**: Reasons given for positions
- **Reciprocity**: Responding to others' arguments
- **Respect**: Civil treatment of opposing views
- **Constructiveness**: Building toward shared understanding

### Scalability Dimensions

From Democracy Next framework:
- **Scaling out**: More participants
- **Scaling up**: Higher governance levels
- **Scaling across**: More processes
- **Scaling deep**: Greater institutionalization
- **Scaling in**: Higher quality
