## Overview

In February-March 2025, researchers at Jigsaw conducted an ethnographic study interviewing 22 professional facilitators across 6 continents. The study explores how expert facilitators work, their mental models, and their emerging approaches to technology and AI.

- Albert Cevallos (CANVAS)
- Cui Jia Wei (vTaiwan)
- Caleb Gichuhi (Build Up)
- Andrea Gallagher (Staple and Spindle)
- Michele Holt-Shannon (University of New Hampshire)
- Nicole Hunter (MosaicLab)
- Emily Jenke (DemocracyCo / Friends of Europe)
- Felix Kufus (CMI)
- Scott Lappan-Newton (Gauge)
- Alice Siu (Stanford University)

## Key Findings

### Facilitation as a "Black Box"

The study addresses a critical gap: deep ethnographic research on facilitation is relatively rare, contributing to a view of facilitation as a "black box" that is crucial yet poorly understood.

### Diverse Definitions of Facilitation

No universally agreed-upon definition exists. Facilitators see their role variously as:

| Metaphor | Role Description |
|----------|------------------|
| **Conductor/Pilot** | Active director of conversation |
| **Referee/Traffic cop** | Rule enforcer |
| **Container** | "Holding" space for group deliberation |

### Cross-Domain Insights

The study draws together facilitation practices from:
- Deliberative democracy
- Peacebuilding and conflict resolution
- Corporate facilitation
- Community engagement
- Mediation

### Emerging AI Approaches

Facilitators are developing diverse approaches to technology and AI integration, with the study capturing early perspectives on AI-assisted facilitation.

## Methodology

- **Interviews:** 22 professional facilitators
- **Geography:** 6 continents, including Global South, active conflict, and post-conflict regions
- **Domains:** Deliberative democracy, peacebuilding, mediation, corporate, community engagement
- **Supplementary research:** Extensive literature review across political theory, political science, peace and conflict studies
- **Observations:** Processes in US, Australia, and Canada

## Key Literature Referenced

The study builds on prior calls for qualitative facilitation research:
- von Schneidemesser et al., 2023 (facilitation as "black box")
- Moore, 2012; Wall and Dunne, 2012 (qualitative research calls)
- Landwehr, 2014; Escobar, 2019 (frameworks and definitions)
- Mansbridge et al., 2006; Ryfe, 2006 (qualitative research)
- Dillard, 2013; Waldman, 2024 (facilitation practices)
- maree brown, 2021 (definitions and frameworks)

## Relevance to OFL

### For Pattern Development
- Provides real-world facilitator mental models
- Reveals diversity of facilitation approaches
- Identifies cross-domain commonalities

### For AI Facilitation
- Captures expert facilitator perspectives on AI
- Highlights what human facilitators value
- Identifies potential risks and opportunities

### For Evaluation
- Qualitative insights complement quantitative frameworks
- Ground truth from diverse practitioner perspectives
