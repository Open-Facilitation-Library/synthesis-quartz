- [[knowledge-base/concepts/ai-facilitation-approaches\|AI Facilitation Approaches]] - Fine-tuning vs inference-time

## Evaluation Frameworks

Tools for assessing facilitation quality through structured comparison. Source: [evals repo](https://github.com/Open-Facilitation-Library/evals).

- [[evals/why-how-who-framework\|Why-How-Who Framework]] — Encode, compare, and evaluate facilitation methodologies
- [[evals/index\|Conversation Signatures]] — Compute measurable similarity to reference methodologies

## OFL Architecture

The Open Facilitation Library has three complementary layers:

- **Patterns** (this knowledge base) — abstract facilitation methodologies: cross-pollination, Delphi, retrospectives, and more. Described using the Why-How-Who framework.
- **[Agent Skills](https://github.com/Open-Facilitation-Library/skills)** — executable agent skills following the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), designed for AI platforms like [Harmonica](https://harmonica.chat) or [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw).
- **[[knowledge-base/workflows|Workflows]]** — how real platforms orchestrate agents into complete facilitation systems. 14 platforms documented with agent roles, participant models, and stage pipelines.
